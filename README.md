# Block-Chain Based Voting System

This project is a blockchain-based voting dapp created in React and Solidity.

## Project Description

“Blockchain-Based Voting System” is a web-based online voting system primarily based on Ethereum blockchain technology. Blockchain is a transparent, distributed and immutable ledger and to overcome the problems of the traditional voting system, blockchain plays a vital role in terms of security, trust and more. Here, anyone eligible for voting can vote for their favorite candidate and they can see the result after the end of the election. It is fast, secure, and has low cost as compared to conventional voting systems. Some key features of our system are:

a) Decentralized & Transparent

b) Trustless

c) Immutable

This project is a basic implementation of a voting system done to understand the basics of Ethereum blockchain technology and the working mechanism of decentralized applications made in Solidity and React. Here, one account that deploys the smart contract is the Admin and he/she can add voters and candidates that are eligible to cast the vote.  Then, the admin starts the election and eligible voters can vote for their favorite candidate. Eventually, when the admin ends the election, the voters can immediately see the final result of the election.
